parameters:
  - id: reclassify
    description: Whether to reclassify the cell grouping
    type: logical
    default: yes
  - id: clthr
    description: real number between zero and one. This is the threshold for the fraction
      of random forest votes required to assign a cell not contained within the target
      clusters to one of these clusters. The value of this parameter should be sufficiently
      high to only reclassify cells with a high-confidence assignment. Default value
      is 0.9.
    type: numeric
    default: 0.9
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 0.1
      upper: 1
  - id: nbfactor
    description: positive integer number. Determines the number of trees grown for
      each random forest. The number of trees is given by the number of columns of
      th training set multiplied by \code{nbfactor}. Default value is 5.
    type: integer
    default: 5
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 2
      upper: 100
  - id: q
    description: q real value between zero and one. This number specifies a threshold
      used for feature selection based on importance sampling. A reduced expression
      table is generated containing only features with an importance larger than the
      q-quantile for at least one of the classes (i. e. target clusters). Default
      value is 0.75.
    type: numeric
    default: 0.75
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 0
      upper: 1
  - id: k
    description: Number of dimensions
    type: integer
    default: 3
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 2
      upper: 100
  - id: m
    description: Dimensionality reduction method to use. Can be tsne, cmd, dm or lle
    type: character
    default: tsne
    values:
    - tsne
    - cmd
    - dm
    - lle
  - id: minnr
    description: integer number of cells per target cluster to be selected for classification
      (test set) in each round of training. For each target cluster, the \code{minnr}
      cells with the highest similarity to a cell in the training set are selected
      for classification. If \code{z} is not \code{NULL} it is used as the similarity
      matrix for this step. Otherwise, \code{1-cor(x)} is used. Default value is 5.
    type: integer
    default: 5
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 2
      upper: 100
  - id: minnrh
    description: integer number of cells from the training set used for classification.
      From each training set, the \code{minnrh} cells with the highest similarity
      to the training set are selected. If \code{z} is not \code{NULL} it is used
      as the similarity matrix for this step. Default value is 10.
    type: integer
    default: 10
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 2
      upper: 100
  - id: trthr
    description: real value representing the threshold of the fraction of random forest
      votes required for the inclusion of a given cell for the computation of the
      principal curve. If \code{NULL} then only cells with a significant bias >1 are
      included for each trajectory. The bias is computed as the ratio of the number
      of votes for a trajectory and the number of votes for the trajectory with the
      second largest number of votes. By this means only the trajectory with the largest
      number of votes will receive a bias >1. The siginifcance is computed based on
      counting statistics on the difference in the number of votes. A significant
      bias requires a p-value < 0.05.
    type: numeric
    default: 0.4
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 0
      upper: 1
  - id: force
    description: Do not use! This is a parameter to force FateID to run on benchmark datasets
      where not enough end groups are present.
    type: logical
    default: no
    tuneable: no
