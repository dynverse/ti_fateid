parameters:
  - id: reclassify
    description: Whether to reclassify the cell grouping
    type: logical
    default: yes
  - id: clthr
    description: real number between zero and one. This is the threshold for the fraction
      of random forest votes required to assign a cell not contained within the target
      clusters to one of these clusters. The value of this parameter should be sufficiently
      high to only reclassify cells with a high-confidence assignment. Default value
      is 0.9.
    type: numeric
    default: 0.9
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 0.1
      upper: 1
  - id: nbfactor
    description: positive integer number. Determines the number of trees grown for
      each random forest. The number of trees is given by the number of columns of
      th training set multiplied by `nbfactor`. Default value is 5.
    type: integer
    default: 5
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 2
      upper: 100
  - id: q
    description: q real value between zero and one. This number specifies a threshold
      used for feature selection based on importance sampling. A reduced expression
      table is generated containing only features with an importance larger than the
      q-quantile for at least one of the classes (i. e. target clusters). Default
      value is 0.75.
    type: numeric
    default: 0.75
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 0
      upper: 1
  - id: k
    description: Number of dimensions
    type: integer
    default: 3
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 2
      upper: 100
  - id: m
    description: Dimensionality reduction method to use. Can be tsne, cmd, dm or lle
    type: character
    default: tsne
    values:
    - tsne
    - cmd
    - dm
    - lle
  - id: minnr
    description: integer number of cells per target cluster to be selected for classification
      (test set) in each round of training. For each target cluster, the `minnr`
      cells with the highest similarity to a cell in the training set are selected
      for classification. If `z` is not `NULL` it is used as the similarity
      matrix for this step. Otherwise, `1-cor(x)` is used. Default value is 5.
    type: integer
    default: 5
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 2
      upper: 100
  - id: minnrh
    description: integer number of cells from the training set used for classification.
      From each training set, the `minnrh` cells with the highest similarity
      to the training set are selected. If `z` is not `NULL` it is used
      as the similarity matrix for this step. Default value is 10.
    type: integer
    default: 10
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 2
      upper: 100
  - id: trthr
    description: real value representing the threshold of the fraction of random forest
      votes required for the inclusion of a given cell for the computation of the
      principal curve. If `NULL` then only cells with a significant bias >1 are
      included for each trajectory. The bias is computed as the ratio of the number
      of votes for a trajectory and the number of votes for the trajectory with the
      second largest number of votes. By this means only the trajectory with the largest
      number of votes will receive a bias >1. The siginifcance is computed based on
      counting statistics on the difference in the number of votes. A significant
      bias requires a p-value < 0.05.
    type: numeric
    default: 0.4
    distribution:
      type: uniform
      lower: 0
      upper: 1
  - id: force
    description: Do not use! This is a parameter to force FateID to run on benchmark datasets
      where not enough end groups are present.
    type: logical
    default: no
    tuneable: no
